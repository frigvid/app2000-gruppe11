# Plans

This here represents ideas for the project. Notes for features that are better documented in-repo than through something like GitHub Discussions, Issues or the like. Note that this means that files here will talk about features that are not yet implemented, may never be implemented (in the state documented), or are in the process of being implemented.

Essentially, treat anything and everything here as a wishlist more than anything concrete.
